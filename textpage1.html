            I hardly remember who i am anymore. one day blends into the next day and, I can hardly tell them apart. . like Im not in my body. I keep waking up to find, ive been walking in my sleep like, my body ends up somewhere else, somewhere familiar. suddenly I have my own home, and vehicles, I am retired so I have lots of time to do the things I like. i like where there is open communication, respect, and each other having their own space, as well as being close, and sharing, with each other. I have a dog, and I am five foot, six inches. I have tats and piercings,i am 43 years old and single. Yes, verifiable. Friends and friends-of-friends have sought my counsel on many issues from the mundane to the absolute serious-as-a-heart-attack happenings in life. See them come and watch them go. I'm in the driveway and a car pulls in to get directions. This State is full of Assholes, yes. However there are extremely great souls as well. truth. The Earth's people have been this way since before recorded by human history. still pretty lost. and we are in a in some winter forest, dark and cold. dark like thirst or hurt It is going to require strength, on your part, in human terms. It's been that way for me for a long time now. treading water.
